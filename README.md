## The Problem

You work across multiple AI coding agents. You make a decision in Antigravity, switch to Claude Code, and it has no idea what you just decided. So you re-explain. Then Cursor needs the same thing. You re-explain again.

Even within the same agent, every new chat starts from zero. The agent has no memory of your stack choices, architectural decisions, or project conventions.

Three problems compound each other:

1. **No context on switch** — switching harnesses loses everything. You re-explain architecture, decisions, and conventions from scratch.
2. **Context rot** — tools that *do* persist memory tend to accumulate everything forever. Bloated memory degrades agent output instead of improving it.
3. **No single source of rules** — each harness wants its own format (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.). Skills you write in one agent never reach another.

## The Solution

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/how-it-works.jpg" alt="How Heald Works" width="85%">
</p>

Heald is a single Rust binary. You install it once. It acts as the shared brain between all your AI agents:

- **One `heald init`** scaffolds the local project store and injects Heald's instructions into the global config of every AI agent on your machine.
- **Skills you have** in any agent (Antigravity, Cursor, Hermes) are automatically imported into `~/.heald/skills/` on init.
- **Every compiled `AGENTS.md`** gets a live routing table pointing at those global skills by absolute path — so any agent, in any project, can load any skill without local copies.
- **`heald remember`** saves decisions into the project's memory store as plain Markdown with optional tags (`--tags`). Any agent in any harness can read them back with `heald context`.
- **BM25 Relevance Scoring & Budget-Aware Pruning** means agents get the exact pertinent subset of memory for the current task (`heald context --relevant "query"`), ranking matches dynamically while respecting token/character limits.
- **Native MCP Server (`heald mcp` / `heald serve`)** speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio so AI agents can query and record memories through structured tools.
- **Skill Management (`heald skill`)** allows listing, searching, and installing reusable skills across global and local scopes.

## What Heald is NOT

| ❌ Not this | ✅ But this |
|---|---|
| A vector database | Plain Markdown + YAML with fast local BM25 ranking |
| A bloated cloud service | Local-first, git-friendly, purely file-based |
| Heavy background runtime | Single fast binary or instant stdio MCP server |
| A Node/Python script | Zero runtime dependencies. Just Rust. |
| An "remember everything" dumper | BM25 relevance scoring + budget-aware recency/pinned pruning |

---

## How It Compares

| Tool | Runtime | Memory | Skills sync | Auto-routing table | BM25 Relevance | MCP Server |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Heald** | Single Rust binary | ✅ Plain Markdown | ✅ Auto-imported from all agents | ✅ Dynamic, from actual skills | ✅ | ✅ |
| Memorix / memsearch | Node / Python MCP server | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Partial | ✅ |
| ai-memory | Node + web UI | ✅ LLM-written | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| agentic-stack | Node + dashboard | ✅ | Partial | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Installation

### Global Installation via crates.io (recommended)

```bash
cargo install heald
```

> Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable). This installs `heald` globally. The binary lands in `~/.cargo/bin/heald` and is immediately available in your path.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parth3930/heald
cd heald
cargo install --path .
```

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1 — Initialize in your project

```bash
cd my-project
heald init
```

This does five things in one command:
- Creates `.heald/` (local memory, rules, skills store)
- Creates `~/.heald/` (global rules and skills — shared across all projects)
- Scans your existing agent skill directories (Antigravity, Cursor, Hermes, etc.) and imports them into `~/.heald/skills/`
- Generates a lightweight repository map in `.heald/map.md`
- Compiles `AGENTS.md` in your project root with a live routing table pointing to those global skills
- Injects Heald's critical instructions into every global agent config file on your machine (`~/.gemini/config/AGENTS.md`, `~/.claude.md`, `~/.cursor/rules/heald.mdc`, `~/.hermes/AGENTS.md`)

---

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Setup

Heald has a built-in MCP server that works over `stdio` (`heald mcp` or `heald serve`).

### Configure in Claude Desktop / Cursor / Antigravity

Add `heald` to your MCP configuration file (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json` or Antigravity MCP settings):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "heald": {
      "command": "heald",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Exposed MCP Tools:
* `heald_recall (query, budget)`: Retrieve project memories, decisions, and manifest filtered by query.
* `heald_remember (type, title, body, tags)`: Record architectural decisions with structured tags.
* `heald_forget (query)`: Remove an outdated memory document.
* `heald_map ()`: Return repository structure with memory cross-references.
* `heald_blame (path)`: Find memory decisions touching a file or directory.
* `heald_doctor ()`: Run integrity diagnostics across rules, skills, and memory bundles.

## Per-Agent Integration Guide

Heald's `init` command handles all of this automatically. This section is for reference or manual setup.

### Antigravity (agy)
**Global config:** `~/.gemini/config/AGENTS.md`  
Heald appends its CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS block. Antigravity reads this on every session start.

### Claude Code
**Global config:** `~/.claude.md`  
Heald appends instructions. Claude Code reads `~/.claude.md` at the start of every conversation.

### Cursor
**Global config:** `~/.cursor/rules/heald.mdc`  
Heald creates this file. Cursor loads all `.mdc` files in `~/.cursor/rules/` globally.

### Hermes
**Global config:** `~/.hermes/AGENTS.md`  
Heald appends instructions. Hermes picks it up automatically.

### Codex
**Global config:** `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`  
Heald appends instructions to the global `.agents` format config.

### Any other agent
Point it at `~/.heald/AGENTS.md`. This is the canonical universal reference file that contains your rules, the routing table for all skills, and the memory instructions. Any agent that can read a Markdown file can use Heald.

## OKF — The Storage Format

Heald uses the **Open Knowledge Format (OKF)** — plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. No proprietary schema, no binary files, no database.

**Memory document:**
```markdown
---
type: decision
title: "Chose PostgreSQL"
timestamp: 2026-08-09T08:00:00Z
tags: [pinned]
---
We need ACID guarantees for financial transactions. MongoDB's eventual consistency
model was incompatible with our requirements.
```

**Rule file:**
```markdown
---
type: rule
title: "API Style"
---
All APIs must be RESTful. GraphQL only if the client needs field-level selection.
```

**Skill file:**
```markdown
---
type: skill
name: "backend-principles"
description: "Use for any backend/API work — building endpoints, auth, data access"
triggers: ["API", "endpoints", "auth", "backend logic"]
---
# Backend Principles
...
```

You can edit these files by hand, `git diff` them, review them in GitHub, or use them without Heald installed at all.

---

## Memory Budget & Pruning

Heald scores each memory document and drops the lowest-scored ones to fit within your token budget:

| Signal | Score |
|---|---|
| `tags: [pinned]` | +1000 |
| Each day since creation | −1 (max: −100) |
| `index.md` | Always included, never dropped |

```bash
# Get context for a 4000-token budget (roughly ~16KB of text)
heald context agents --budget 4000
```

The output header tells you exactly what was included and what was dropped:
```
<!-- Heald Context: Included 4/7 memory documents (Budget: 16000 chars) -->
```

## FAQ

**Why not just maintain `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` by hand?**
You can, for one agent. The problem is five different agents each want their own
format and location (`~/.claude.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `~/.gemini/config/AGENTS.md`...).
Heald keeps one source of truth and compiles/injects it into every format automatically,
so you edit rules in one place instead of five.

**What happens to memory that's not relevant anymore?**
`heald forget <title>` removes a specific memory document. Budget-aware pruning also
keeps low-value (old, unpinned) memory out of context automatically without deleting it —
so it's still on disk if you need it, just not clogging every prompt.

**Does this send my code or memory anywhere?**
No. Heald is local-first — everything lives in `.heald/` and `~/.heald/` as plain
Markdown files. No network calls, no telemetry, no cloud sync.

**What if two agents write memory at the same time?**
Known v0.1 limitation — no file locking yet on shared files (`AGENTS.md`, `log.md`).
Avoid running multiple agents concurrently against the same project until this lands
(tracked in Known Limitations / Contributing).

---

## Known Limitations (v0.1)

- **No file locking:** Concurrent `heald sync` or `heald finalize` calls can race on shared files (`AGENTS.md`, `log.md`). Documented limitation — avoid running multiple agents simultaneously writing memory.
- **Silent skip on malformed files:** `heald context` skips broken OKF files rather than crashing the agent session. Use `heald doctor` to find them.
- **Codex:** Hook injection is not yet implemented for Codex-specific native format. The `.agents/AGENTS.md` fallback works.
